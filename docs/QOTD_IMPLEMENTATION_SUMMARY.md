## Technical Highlights

### Smart Question Rotation

**Auto-Creation:**
- API checks if question exists for today
- If none: randomly picks from 15-question pool
- Creates new QuestionOfTheDay document
- All automatic, no manual work!

### Vote Tracking

**LocalStorage (Client-Side):**
- `qotd_voted_date` = "Wed Oct 30 2025"
- Prevents duplicate votes on same day
- Resets at midnight automatically
- No account/login required

**Database (Server-Side):**
- Atomic vote increments (`$inc`)
- Real-time percentage calculations
- All votes anonymous
- No user tracking

### Auto-Prompt System

**Smart Timing:**
- Shows 3 seconds after landing on homepage
- Only if user hasn't voted today
- Only if user hasn't dismissed today
- Dismissible (won't show again today)

**LocalStorage Keys:**
- `qotd_voted_date` - Last vote date
- `qotd_dismissed_date` - Last dismissal date
