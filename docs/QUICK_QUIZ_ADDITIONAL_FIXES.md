# Quick Quiz Additional Fixes - October 31, 2025

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue #6: Question correctAnswer Field Type Mismatch in Create API ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Problem:** The create API accepts `correctAnswer` as an index (number) but the database expects it as text (string).

**File:** `/app/api/quick-quiz/create/route.ts`

**Fix:**
```typescript
// BEFORE - Accepts correctAnswer as any type
const questionDocs = await Question.insertMany(
  questions.map((q: any) => ({
    questionText: q.questionText,
    options: q.options,
    correctAnswer: q.correctAnswer,  // Could be number!
    points: 10,
  }))
);

// AFTER - Convert index to actual answer text
const questionDocs = await Question.insertMany(
  questions.map((q: any) => ({
    questionText: q.questionText,
    options: q.options,
    // Convert index to actual answer text
    correctAnswer: typeof q.correctAnswer === 'number' 
      ? q.options[q.correctAnswer] 
      : q.correctAnswer,
    points: 10,
  }))
);
```

### Issue #7: Missing Error Handling for Ably Connection Failures

**Problem:** If Ably fails to connect, the app doesn't handle it gracefully.

**Files:** Multiple

**Fix:** Add try-catch around Ably operations with fallback behavior.

### Issue #8: Quiz Not Marked as Completed

**Problem:** When quiz ends, `isCompleted` is never set to true, causing stale quizzes.

**Solution:** Create a quiz completion endpoint.

### Issue #9: No Cleanup of Old Quick Quizzes

**Problem:** Quick quizzes accumulate in database forever.

**Solution:** TTL index already exists in Test model (24 hours) - verified it's working.

### Issue #10: Missing Validation for timeLimitPerQuestion

**Problem:** Could create quiz with 0 or negative time limit.

**File:** `/app/api/quick-quiz/create/route.ts`

**Fix:** Add validation.
