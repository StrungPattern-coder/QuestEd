# Quick Quiz Live Page Implementation

## Overview

Created the missing `/quick-quiz/[id]/live` page that was causing 404 errors when hosts started a quiz. This page provides real-time monitoring of quiz progress with live leaderboard, question display, and automatic advancement.

## Problem

When a host clicked "Start Quiz" in the waiting room (`/quick-quiz/[id]/host`), they were redirected to `/quick-quiz/[id]/live` which didn't exist, resulting in a 404 error.

## Solution

### 1. Created Live Quiz Monitoring Page

**File**: `/app/quick-quiz/[id]/live/page.tsx` (664 lines)

**Key Features**:

#### Real-Time Updates via Ably
- Subscribes to `quick-quiz-${testId}` channel
- Listens for `answer-submitted` events from participants
- Listens for `participant-joined` events
- Updates leaderboard and recent answers in real-time

#### Live Leaderboard
- Displays top 10 participants with scores
- Shows position changes (↑/↓ indicators)
- Gold/silver/bronze badges for top 3
- Updates instantly when participants answer

#### Question Display
- Shows current question with all options
- Highlights correct answer in green
- Progress bar (Question X of Y)
- Visual countdown timer

#### Recent Answers Feed
- Shows last 10 answers submitted
- Displays participant name, correctness, and time taken
- Green background for correct, red for incorrect
- Animated entry with Framer Motion

#### Timer System
- Countdown per question
- Visual warning when ≤10 seconds
- Auto-advances to next question on timeout
- Manual "Next Question" button override

#### Flow Control
- Automatic progression through questions
- Completes quiz after last question
- Shows podium with top 3 finishers
- Redirects to full results page

### 2. Updated Participant Answer Publishing

**File**: `/app/quick-quiz/[id]/take/page.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Updated `handleAnswerSubmit` to publish answers to Ably
- Made function async to handle Ably publishing
- Calculates time taken to answer
- Publishes comprehensive answer data:
  ```typescript
  {
    participantName: string,
    questionIndex: number,
    selectedAnswer: number,
    isCorrect: boolean,
    score: number,          // Updated total score
    timeToAnswer: number,   // Seconds taken
    timestamp: number       // For ordering
  }
  ```

## Architecture

### Data Flow

```
Participant (take page)
  ↓
  Answers question
  ↓
  Publishes to Ably: 'answer-submitted'
  ↓
Host (live page)
  ↓
  Receives event via subscription
  ↓
  Updates leaderboard & recent answers
  ↓
  Shows position changes
```

### State Management (Live Page)

```typescript
// Core State
questions: Question[]           // All quiz questions
currentQuestionIndex: number    // Current question (0-based)
participants: ParticipantScore[] // All participants with scores
recentAnswers: AnswerSubmission[] // Last 10 answers
timeLeft: number                // Countdown for current question
isQuizComplete: boolean         // Quiz ended?
showPodium: boolean             // Show top 3?

// Interfaces
interface ParticipantScore {
  name: string;
  score: number;
  positionChange?: number; // ↑3 or ↓2
}

interface AnswerSubmission {
  participantName: string;
  isCorrect: boolean;
  timeToAnswer: number;
  timestamp: number;
}
```

### Ably Event Structure

**Event**: `answer-submitted`
```typescript
{
  participantName: "John Doe",
  questionIndex: 2,
  selectedAnswer: 1,
  isCorrect: true,
  score: 3,              // Total score after this answer
  timeToAnswer: 12,      // Seconds taken
  timestamp: 1703001234567
}
```

**Event**: `participant-joined`
```typescript
{
  name: "Jane Smith",
  timestamp: 1703001234567
}
```

## UI/UX Design

### Layout (Desktop)

│  D) 6                │  • Jane: Wrong (8s)      │
│                      │  • Bob: Correct (15s)    │
│  [Next Question →]   │                          │

4. **No Question Repeat**: Cannot go back to previous questions
5. **Single Session**: Refreshing loses position tracking data
