## 🔧 How It Works

### Flow Diagram:
```
Teacher invites student
    ↓
POST /api/teacher/classrooms/[id]/invite
    ↓
1. Verify teacher authentication
2. Find student by email
3. Check if already enrolled
4. Add student to classroom.students[]
5. Save classroom
    ↓
6. Fetch teacher name
7. Generate join link
8. Call sendClassroomInvitation()
    ↓
9. Nodemailer creates SMTP transport
10. Render HTML template with data
11. Send email via SMTP server
    ↓
12. Return success response
    {
      message: "Student added and email sent",
      student: {...},
      emailSent: true,
      inviteLink: "..."
    }
```

### Error Handling:
- **Student not found**: Returns 404 with helpful message
- **Already enrolled**: Returns 400 with friendly error
- **Email fails**: Student still added, returns success with `emailSent: false`
- **SMTP error**: Logs error, continues with fallback
