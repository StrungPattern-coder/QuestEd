# Live Quiz Enhancements - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document details the comprehensive enhancements made to the QuestEd live quiz system, including randomized celebration animations, real-time question-by-question leaderboard updates, and proper player initialization.

## 🎉 Feature 1: Randomized Celebration Animations

### Problem
- Only one celebration animation (confetti) was used for correct answers
- Experience became repetitive and predictable

### Solution
Created a comprehensive celebrations library with 7 different animation types that are randomly selected.

### Implementation

**File Created:** `/lib/celebrations.ts`

**Available Animations:**
1. **Classic Confetti** - Orange-themed particle burst
2. **Fireworks** - Multi-burst colorful explosions from sides
3. **Star Burst** - Golden stars with circles radiating outward
4. **Sparkle Rain** - Continuous sparkles from both sides
5. **Emoji Celebration** - Colorful circular particles
6. **Side Cannons** - Rainbow confetti shot from left and right
7. **Realistic Confetti** - Multi-stage confetti with varying speeds and sizes

**Key Functions:**
- `triggerRandomCelebration()` - Randomly selects and triggers one of the 7 animations
- `triggerCelebration(type)` - Triggers a specific animation type
- Individual functions for each animation type

**Integration:**
- Updated `/app/dashboard/student/tests/[id]/take/page.tsx`
- Replaced all `confetti()` calls with `triggerRandomCelebration()`
- Applied to both:
  - Individual question correct answers
  - Test completion celebrations

## 📊 Feature 2: Question-by-Question Leaderboard Updates

### Problem
- Leaderboard only updated when students completed the entire test
- Only the first student to complete appeared on the leaderboard
- No real-time feedback during the quiz (unlike Kahoot)

### Solution
Implemented real-time leaderboard updates after each question submission with time-based scoring system.

### Architecture

#### Scoring System
```
Base Points: 100 per correct answer
Time Bonus: up to 50 points based on speed
Formula: points = 100 + max(0, floor(((timeLimit - timeSpent) / timeLimit) * 50))

Example:
- Time limit: 30 seconds
- Answered in: 10 seconds
- Time bonus: floor(((30-10)/30) * 50) = 33 points
- Total points: 100 + 33 = 133 points
```

#### API Endpoints Created

**1. `/api/student/tests/[id]/join-live` (POST)**
- **Purpose:** Add player to leaderboard when they join a live test
- **Actions:**
  - Creates/finds leaderboard for the test
  - Adds student with 0 score
  - Broadcasts updated leaderboard via Ably
- **Response:** Test details + current leaderboard

**2. `/api/student/tests/[id]/submit-question` (POST)**
- **Purpose:** Submit answer for a single question and update leaderboard
- **Actions:**
  - Validates answer against correct answer
  - Calculates points based on time spent
  - Updates/creates submission record
  - Recalculates rankings
  - Broadcasts updated leaderboard
- **Request Body:**
  ```typescript
  {
    questionId: string;
    selectedAnswer: number;
    questionIndex: number;
    timeSpent: number; // in seconds
  }
  ```
- **Response:**
  ```typescript
  {
    isCorrect: boolean;
    points: number;
    currentScore: number;
    currentRank: number;
    answeredQuestions: number;
    totalQuestions: number;
    leaderboard: LeaderboardEntry[];
  }
  ```

**3. `/api/student/tests/[id]/leaderboard` (GET)**
- **Purpose:** Fetch current leaderboard state
- **Response:** Current rankings with answered questions count

#### Model Updates

**File:** `/backend/models/Submission.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added `points?: number` to IAnswer interface (time-based scoring)
- Added `timeSpent?: number` to IAnswer interface (tracking answer time)
- Added `maxScore?: number` to ISubmission interface
- Updated AnswerSchema to include new fields

**Before:**
```typescript
interface IAnswer {
  questionId: mongoose.Types.ObjectId;
  selectedAnswer: string;
  isCorrect: boolean;
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
interface IAnswer {
  questionId: mongoose.Types.ObjectId;
  selectedAnswer: string;
  isCorrect: boolean;
  points?: number;
  timeSpent?: number;
}
```

## 👥 Feature 3: Show All Players at Start

### Problem
- Leaderboard was empty until first submission
- Players couldn't see who else joined
- No indication of quiz participants

### Solution
Immediate leaderboard initialization when players join.

### Flow

1. **Student Joins Live Test:**
   ```
   Student navigates to test → fetchTest() detects mode='live'
   → joinLiveTest() API call → Student added to leaderboard with 0 score
   → Leaderboard broadcast to all participants
   ```

2. **Real-Time Updates:**
   - Uses Ably pub/sub for instant updates
   - Every answer submission triggers leaderboard recalculation
   - All connected clients receive updated rankings

3. **Teacher View:**
   - Subscribed to same Ably channel
   - Shows real-time participant count
   - Displays live ranking updates

---

## 🔄 Real-Time Communication

### Ably Integration

**File:** `/lib/ably.ts`

**Functions Used:**
- `subscribeToLeaderboard(testId, callback)` - Listen for leaderboard updates
- `publishLeaderboardUpdate(testId, data)` - Broadcast leaderboard changes

**Channel Names:**
- `leaderboard-${testId}` - For live leaderboard updates

### Update Flow
```
Student submits answer
  ↓
API calculates score & updates database
  ↓
API sorts rankings
  ↓
API publishes to Ably channel
  ↓
All connected clients receive update
  ↓
UI updates leaderboard display
```

- [ ] Student loses connection mid-test
- [ ] Multiple students submit at exact same time
- [ ] Student with all correct but slow answers vs fast with some wrong

---

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables
No new environment variables required. Existing Ably configuration is sufficient:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ABLY_KEY` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_ABLY_CLIENT_KEY`

### Database
No migrations required. Mongoose will automatically handle new optional fields in Submission model.

### Performance Considerations
- Ably broadcasts are lightweight (JSON payload ~1-2KB per update)
- Each question submission triggers one leaderboard recalculation
- O(n log n) sorting for n participants (efficient for typical class sizes)
- Consider rate limiting for very large quizzes (100+ participants)

---

## 📊 Technical Specifications

### Time Tracking
- Tracked per question in milliseconds, stored in seconds
- Starts when question loads (`questionStartTime = Date.now()`)
- Ends when answer is submitted
- Accounts for auto-submission when time runs out

### Score Calculation
```typescript
// Live Tests (new)
const basePoints = 100;
const timeLimit = test.timeLimitPerQuestion;
const timeBonus = Math.max(0, Math.floor(((timeLimit - timeSpent) / timeLimit) * 50));
const points = isCorrect ? basePoints + timeBonus : 0;

// Non-Live Tests (unchanged)
const score = correctAnswers.length;
```

### Rank Calculation
```typescript
// Sort by score descending
leaderboard.rankings.sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score);

// Assign sequential ranks
leaderboard.rankings.forEach((ranking, index) => {
  ranking.rank = index + 1;
});
```

## 🎓 Developer Guide

### Adding a New Celebration Animation

1. Create function in `/lib/celebrations.ts`:
```typescript
export const celebrateWithMyAnimation = () => {
  confetti({
    // Your custom configuration
  });
};
```

2. Add to celebrations array:
```typescript
const celebrations = [
  // ...existing
  celebrateWithMyAnimation,
];
```

### Modifying Point Calculation

Edit `/app/api/student/tests/[id]/submit-question/route.ts`:
```typescript
// Adjust base points or time bonus formula
const basePoints = 100;  // Change base
const maxTimeBonus = 50; // Change max bonus
const timeBonus = Math.max(0, Math.floor(
  ((timeLimit - timeSpent) / timeLimit) * maxTimeBonus
));
```

### Customizing Leaderboard Display

Edit `/app/dashboard/teacher/tests/[id]/live/page.tsx` line 378-419 for teacher view.
The UI already handles:
- Medal icons for top 3 (🥇🥈🥉)
- Color coding (gold/silver/bronze/default)
- Progress indicators (answered questions)
- Real-time updates animation

---

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Network Latency** - Leaderboard updates depend on network speed
2. **Time Sync** - Client clocks may differ slightly (acceptable variance ~1s)
3. **Ably Connection** - Requires stable internet for real-time updates
4. **Quick Quiz Integration** - This implementation focuses on classroom tests (teacherId required)

### Workarounds
- For Quick Quiz (guest quizzes), similar implementation needed but without authentication requirements
- Connection loss handled gracefully (updates resume when reconnected)
- Time discrepancies minimal impact due to relative scoring
