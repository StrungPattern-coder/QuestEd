## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Question Upload Issues

**Problem:** "No valid questions found"
- **Solution:** Check file format matches examples
- Ensure CSV has header row
- Verify JSON is valid (use jsonlint.com)

**Problem:** "Failed to parse file"
- **Solution:** Check for:
  - Special characters in CSV (use quotes)
  - Commas inside question text (use quotes)
  - JSON syntax errors (missing brackets/commas)

**Problem:** Wrong correct answer
- **Solution:** In CSV, correct answer must EXACTLY match one option
- In JSON, `correctAnswer` must EXACTLY match one option in `options` array

### Export Issues

**Problem:** No data in CSV
- **Solution:** Wait for students to submit tests first
- Check if test has any submissions

   - `german-advanced-grammar-50questions.json`

3. **Version Control**

   - Track what changed

4. **Quality Check**
   - Review Step 3 preview before creating test
   - Verify correct answers are properly set

### Test Management

1. **Regular Monitoring**
   - Check "All Tests" dashboard weekly
   - Monitor submission rates

2. **Download Results**
   - Export after each test for records
   - Back up important assessments

3. **Analyze Patterns**
