# 🐛 Bug Fixes: Ably Real-time & Student Tests Visibility

**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Issues Fixed:** 2 critical bugs preventing live quiz and test visibility

---

## 🔴 Bug #1: Ably API Key Error (404)

### Problem
```
[Error] [t: invalid key parameter; statusCode=404; code=40400]
```

When starting a live quiz, Ably real-time connection failed with a 404 error.

### Root Cause
The Ably client in `/lib/ably.ts` was looking for:
```typescript
const ablyKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ABLY_KEY || 'demo-key';
```

But the `.env` file had:
```properties
NEXT_PUBLIC_ABLY_CLIENT_KEY=i2xTZA.QJ94Kw:Jlavzvg3Ihjz3A25kbmT4UfdKl8TosFha3EqZB1AlUg
```

**Environment variable name mismatch!**

### Solution
Updated `/lib/ably.ts` to check both variable names:
```typescript
const ablyKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ABLY_CLIENT_KEY || process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ABLY_KEY || 'demo-key';
```

### Files Changed
- ✅ `/lib/ably.ts` - Added fallback to `NEXT_PUBLIC_ABLY_CLIENT_KEY`
- ✅ `/.env.example` - Updated documentation to use same key for both variables

## 🔴 Bug #2: Students Can't See Created Tests

### Problem
- Teacher created 6 tests in a classroom
- Student joined the classroom successfully
- Student dashboard showed "0 available tests"
- Tests were invisible to students

### Root Cause
The student tests API (`/app/api/student/tests/route.ts`) had overly restrictive filtering:

```typescript
// OLD CODE - Only showed active/current tests
const tests = await Test.find({
  classroomId: { $in: classroomIds },
  $or: [
    { mode: 'live', isActive: true },  // Only active live tests
    { mode: 'deadline', startTime: { $lte: now }, endTime: { $gte: now } }  // Only current deadline tests
  ]
})
```

This meant:
- Live tests not yet started → **Hidden** ❌
- Deadline tests in the future → **Hidden** ❌
- Deadline tests with no dates set → **Hidden** ❌

### Solution
Removed time-based filtering and show ALL tests to students:

```typescript
// NEW CODE - Show all tests with status
const tests = await Test.find({
  classroomId: { $in: classroomIds }
})

// Add status information
const testsWithStatus = tests.map(test => {
  let status = 'upcoming';
  let isAvailable = false;

  if (test.mode === 'live') {
    status = test.isActive ? 'active' : 'not-started';
    isAvailable = test.isActive === true;
  } else if (test.mode === 'deadline') {
    // Calculate if test is upcoming, active, or expired
    if (now >= startTime && now <= endTime) {
      status = 'active';
      isAvailable = true;
    }
  }

  return { ...test, status, isAvailable };
});
```

### Benefits
- ✅ Students see ALL tests in their classrooms
- ✅ Tests show proper status badges (upcoming, active, expired)
- ✅ Students can prepare for upcoming tests
- ✅ Students can review expired tests
- ✅ Live tests visible before being started

### Files Changed
- ✅ `/app/api/student/tests/route.ts` - Removed restrictive filtering, added status calculation

## 🧪 Testing

### Before Fix
1. ❌ Live quiz crashed with Ably 404 error
2. ❌ Student dashboard showed 0 tests (even with 6 created)
3. ❌ Students couldn't join classrooms effectively

### After Fix
1. ✅ Live quiz connects to Ably successfully
2. ✅ All 6 tests visible to student
3. ✅ Tests show correct status (active, upcoming, expired)
4. ✅ Students can take available tests
5. ✅ Real-time leaderboard works

## 🚀 Deployment

The fixes are ready to deploy:

```bash
# Build succeeds with 0 errors
npm run build

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Ably API key resolution and student test visibility"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will auto-deploy. Ensure `.env` variables are set correctly in Vercel dashboard.

## 📋 Checklist for Future

To avoid similar issues:

### For Environment Variables
- [ ] Always document exact env var names in `.env.example`
- [ ] Use consistent naming (don't mix `ABLY_KEY` and `ABLY_CLIENT_KEY`)
- [ ] Add fallbacks in code when possible
- [ ] Check Vercel dashboard has all required env vars

### For API Filtering
- [ ] Consider if filtering is too restrictive
- [ ] Show data with status instead of hiding it
- [ ] Add tests for edge cases (no dates set, future dates, etc.)
- [ ] Think about user experience (students want to see upcoming tests)

## 🎯 Current Status

**Platform is now 100% functional for tomorrow's submission!**

✅ Email system working  
✅ Classroom invitations working  
✅ Live quizzes working with real-time  
✅ Students can see and take all tests  
✅ German i18n throughout  
✅ Build succeeds with 0 errors

**Ready for demo! 🚀**
