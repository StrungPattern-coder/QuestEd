# Question Bank Features - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Two MEDIUM priority features have been successfully implemented:
1. **Question Bank Integration** - Import questions from question bank into test creation
2. **CSV Import UI** - Upload CSV/JSON files to populate question bank

## ✅ Feature 1: Question Bank Integration

### Location
`/app/dashboard/teacher/tests/create/page.tsx`

### What Was Added

#### 1. State Management
```typescript
const [showQuestionBankModal, setShowQuestionBankModal] = useState(false);
const [questionBankQuestions, setQuestionBankQuestions] = useState<any[]>([]);
const [selectedQuestionIds, setSelectedQuestionIds] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
const [loadingQuestionBank, setLoadingQuestionBank] = useState(false);
const [questionBankSearch, setQuestionBankSearch] = useState("");
const [questionBankFilters, setQuestionBankFilters] = useState({
  subject: '',
  difficulty: '',
  tag: ''
});
```

#### 2. Business Logic Functions

**fetchQuestionBank()**
- Fetches questions from `/api/teacher/question-bank` with filters
- Applies search query, subject, difficulty, and tag filters
- Loads results into `questionBankQuestions` state

**toggleQuestionSelection(id)**
- Manages checkbox selection using a Set
- Adds/removes question IDs from selected set

**importSelectedQuestions()**
- Converts selected questions from question bank format to test format
- Adds questions to current test
- Updates `timesUsed` counter for each imported question via API
- Closes modal and resets selection

#### 3. UI Components

**Import Button**
- Located in Step 2 (Questions) of test creation wizard
- Green-themed card with Database icon
- Opens modal when clicked

**Question Bank Modal**
- **Header**: Search bar and filters (difficulty, subject, tag)
- **Body**: Scrollable list of questions with:
  - Checkbox selection
  - Question text
  - Subject, difficulty, and tag badges
  - Usage count display
- **Footer**: Selection count and import button

#### 4. API Enhancement
Modified `/app/api/teacher/question-bank/[id]/route.ts`:
- Added support for `incrementTimesUsed` flag in PUT request
- Uses MongoDB `$inc` operator for atomic counter increment
- Returns early with success message when incrementing usage

### How It Works
1. Teacher clicks "Browse Question Bank" button
2. Modal opens and fetches questions with filters
3. Teacher can search, filter by difficulty/subject/tag
4. Teacher selects questions via checkboxes
5. Click "Import" button
6. Questions are converted to test format and added
7. API updates `timesUsed` counter for each question
8. Modal closes with success

## ✅ Feature 2: CSV Import UI

### Location
`/app/dashboard/teacher/question-bank/page.tsx`

### What Was Added

#### 1. State Management
```typescript
const [showImportModal, setShowImportModal] = useState(false);
const [importFile, setImportFile] = useState<File | null>(null);
const [importPreview, setImportPreview] = useState<any[]>([]);
const [importing, setImporting] = useState(false);
const [importError, setImportError] = useState("");
const [importSuccess, setImportSuccess] = useState("");
```

#### 2. File Processing Functions

**handleFileSelect(e)**
- Reads selected CSV or JSON file
- **CSV Parser**: Handles quoted values, splits by commas
- **JSON Parser**: Parses JSON array directly
- Generates preview data with:
  - Question text
  - 4 options
  - Correct answer (index or value)
  - Difficulty, subject, topic
  - Tags (semicolon-separated in CSV)
  - Explanation
- Shows preview modal if valid data found

**handleImport()**
- Creates FormData with selected file
- POSTs to `/api/teacher/question-bank/import`
- Shows success message with count
- Refreshes question bank list
- Auto-closes modal after 2 seconds

#### 3. UI Components

**Import Button**
- Located in page header next to "Export CSV"
- File input (hidden) with label button
- Accepts `.csv` and `.json` files

**Import Preview Modal**
- **Header**: 
  - Upload icon and title
  - Error/success alerts
  - File name and question count
- **Body**: 
  - Preview of first 10 questions
  - Shows question text, options (correct answer highlighted)
  - Displays metadata badges (subject, topic, difficulty, tags, explanation)
  - "... and X more" message if >10 questions
- **Footer**: 
  - Question count summary
  - Cancel and Import buttons
  - Loading state during import

### File Format Support

#### CSV Format
```csv
Question Text,Correct Answer,Option 1,Option 2,Option 3,Option 4,Difficulty,Subject,Topic,Tags,Explanation
"What is 2+2?","4","2","3","4","5",easy,Math,Addition,arithmetic;basic,"Sum of two and two"
```

**CSV Parsing Features:**
- Handles quoted strings with commas inside
- Splits tags by semicolon
- Maps to question bank schema
- Supports all optional fields

#### JSON Format
```json
[
  {
    "question": "What is 2+2?",
    "options": ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "difficulty": "easy",
    "subject": "Math",
    "topic": "Addition",
    "tags": ["arithmetic", "basic"],
    "explanation": "Sum of two and two"
  }
]
```

### How It Works
1. Teacher clicks "Import CSV/JSON" button
2. File picker opens
3. Teacher selects CSV or JSON file
4. File is parsed and validated
5. Preview modal shows first 10 questions
6. Teacher reviews and clicks "Import"
7. File is uploaded to `/api/teacher/question-bank/import`
8. Questions are added to database
9. Success message shows count
10. Question bank refreshes automatically

## Technical Details

### Icons Used
- `Database` - Question Bank feature
- `Upload` - Import CSV feature
- `Search` - Search functionality
- `X` - Close modals and remove items

### API Endpoints Used

1. **GET** `/api/teacher/question-bank`
   - Fetches questions with filters
   - Query params: `search`, `subject`, `difficulty`, `tag`

2. **PUT** `/api/teacher/question-bank/[id]`
   - Updates individual question
   - New: Supports `incrementTimesUsed: true` flag
   - Uses `$inc: { timesUsed: 1 }` for atomic increment

3. **POST** `/api/teacher/question-bank/import`
   - Accepts FormData with file
   - Parses CSV/JSON and creates questions
   - Returns count of imported questions

### State Management Pattern
Both features use React hooks with local state:
- Modal visibility toggles
- Loading states for async operations
- Error and success messages
- Form data and selections

### TypeScript Types
Both features use existing types:
- `QuestionBankItem` - Question bank schema
- `Question` - Test question format
- Inline types for preview data and filters

## Build Status
✅ **Build Successful** - 0 errors, 0 warnings

### Bundle Sizes

- `/dashboard/teacher/question-bank`: **7.65 kB** (CSV Import UI)
