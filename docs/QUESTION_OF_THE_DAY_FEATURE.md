## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

**Model:** `QuestionOfTheDay`

```typescript
interface IQuestionOfTheDay {
  question: string;        // e.g., "Cats or Dogs?"
  optionA: string;         // e.g., "üê± Cats"
  optionB: string;         // e.g., "üê∂ Dogs"
  date: Date;              // Unique per day (midnight UTC)

  isActive: boolean;       // Can be disabled
  category: string;        // Sports, Entertainment, Food, Tech, General
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

**Indexes:**
- `date` (descending) + `isActive` - Fast lookup for today's question

**Key Features:**
1. **State Management:**
   - Question data from API
   - Vote status (voted/not voted)
   - Selected option tracking
   - Modal open/close
   - Prompt visibility

2. **LocalStorage Tracking:**
   - `qotd_voted_date` - Stores date of last vote

   - Prevents duplicate votes per day
   - Controls prompt visibility

3. **Auto-Prompt Logic:**
   - Shows 3 seconds after page load

   - Only if user hasn't dismissed today
   - Dismissible with "X" button

4. **Vote Validation:**
   - Checks if already voted (localStorage)
   - Disables buttons during API call
   - Shows loading state
   - Prevents duplicate submissions

5. **Results Display:**
   - Animated progress bars (0% ‚Üí final %)
   - Percentage text (large, bold)
   - "Your choice" indicator
   - Total vote count

### Integration Points

**Landing Page (`/app/page.tsx`):**
```tsx
import QuestionOfTheDay from "@/components/QuestionOfTheDay";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      {/* ... existing content ... */}
      
      <QuestionOfTheDay />
    </main>
  );
}
```

**Position:** Fixed bottom-right, z-index 50 (above all content)

## Question Management

### Current System: Auto-Rotation

**How It Works:**
- API checks if question exists for today
- If not, randomly selects from 15-question pool
- Creates new question document for today
- Question changes at midnight UTC

**Advantages:**
- Zero manual work
- Always has a question
- Variety from curated pool

### Future Enhancement: Manual Curation

**Admin Panel (Future):**
1. Create custom questions
2. Schedule questions for specific dates
3. Import questions from CSV
4. View vote statistics
5. Deactivate inappropriate questions

**Schema Addition:**
```typescript
{
  scheduledDate?: Date;    // Pre-schedule questions
  createdBy?: ObjectId;    // Admin who created it
  isCustom: boolean;       // User-created vs pool
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies

**Component:**
- Lazy load modal content (only render when open)
- Memoize question data
- Debounce vote button clicks
- Use AnimatePresence for smooth unmounting

**API:**
- Cache today's question (Redis in future)
- Atomic vote increments (no race conditions)
- Index on date field for fast queries

**LocalStorage:**
- Store only date strings (not full objects)
- Clear old entries periodically
- No PII stored

### Scalability

**Current Capacity:**
- Unlimited votes per question
- New question auto-created daily
- No server-side user tracking

**At Scale:**
- Add rate limiting (prevent spam)
- Use Redis for real-time vote counts
- Implement vote caching (update every 5s)
- Add CDN for static question pool
