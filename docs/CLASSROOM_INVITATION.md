# Classroom Invitation System

## Overview
The QuestEd platform now includes a complete classroom management system with student invitation functionality.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Classroom Detail Page (`/dashboard/teacher/classrooms/[id]`)
Teachers can now click on any classroom card to view:
- Classroom name and description
- List of all enrolled students with their names and emails
- Statistics (total students, tests created, creation date)
- Ability to invite new students
- Ability to remove students

### 2. Invite Students (Two Methods)

#### Method A: Email Invitation
1. Navigate to classroom detail page
2. Enter student's email address in the invite form
3. Click "Send Invitation"
4. Student is immediately added to the classroom
5. Success message confirms invitation was sent

**Requirements:**
- Student must have an account with the provided email
- Email must end with `@ms.pict.edu` (student email format)
- Student cannot already be enrolled in the classroom

#### Method B: Share Link
1. Click "Copy Invite Link" button on classroom detail page
2. Share the link with students via any communication channel
3. Students click the link to join the classroom automatically

### 3. Student Join Flow
When a student clicks an invitation link:
1. If not logged in, redirected to login page with return URL
2. After login, automatically enrolled in the classroom
3. Success page shows confirmation message
4. Auto-redirected to student dashboard after 2 seconds
5. Student can now see all tests in the joined classroom

## API Endpoints Created

### Teacher API
- `POST /api/teacher/classrooms/[id]/invite` - Invite student by email
  - Body: `{ studentEmail: string }`
  - Returns: Success message and student details
  - Errors: Student not found, already enrolled, unauthorized

### Student API
- `POST /api/student/join-classroom/[id]` - Join classroom via link
  - Requires authentication token
  - Returns: Success message and classroom name
  - Errors: Classroom not found, already enrolled, unauthorized

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. `/app/dashboard/teacher/classrooms/[id]/page.tsx` - Classroom detail page
2. `/app/api/teacher/classrooms/[id]/invite/route.ts` - Invite API endpoint
3. `/app/join-classroom/[id]/page.tsx` - Student join confirmation page
4. `/app/api/student/join-classroom/[id]/route.ts` - Join classroom API endpoint

### Modified Files
1. `/lib/api.ts` - Added `inviteStudent()` method to teacherApi

## Email Integration (Fully Implemented) ✅

The email invitation system is **fully implemented** using Nodemailer with direct SMTP configuration. **No third-party services required!**

### Features
- ✅ Direct SMTP email sending (no API dependencies)
- ✅ Beautiful HTML email templates with QuestEd branding
- ✅ Plain text fallback for all email clients
- ✅ Automatic email sending on student invitation
- ✅ Graceful fallback if email fails (student still added)

### Quick Setup

Add to `.env`:
```env
# Email Configuration
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=QuestEd <your-email@gmail.com>
```

### For Gmail Users (Recommended)
1. Enable 2-Step Verification on your Google Account
2. Generate App Password at: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
3. Use the 16-character app password in `SMTP_PASS`

### Test Your Configuration
```bash
node test-email.js your-email@gmail.com
```

### Email Providers Supported
- ✅ Gmail (recommended for development)
- ✅ Outlook/Hotmail
- ✅ Custom domain SMTP (cPanel, Namecheap, etc.)
- ✅ AWS SES
- ✅ Any SMTP server

**See EMAIL_SETUP.md for complete configuration guide!**

## Usage Example

### Teacher Workflow
1. Create a classroom
2. Click on the classroom card
3. Enter student email: `student@ms.pict.edu`
4. Click "Send Invitation"
5. Student appears in the enrolled students list
6. Create tests for the classroom
7. Start live tests

### Student Workflow
1. Receive classroom invitation link
2. Click the link (or teacher enters email directly)
3. Login if needed
4. Automatically enrolled
5. Dashboard now shows all classroom tests
6. Join live tests using join codes

## Security Features
- JWT authentication required for all operations
- Teachers can only invite students to their own classrooms
- Students can only join classrooms they're invited to
- Email validation ensures proper domain formats
- Duplicate enrollment prevention

## Next Steps
1. Integrate Resend or SendGrid for actual email delivery
2. Add email templates with proper styling
3. Add notification system for real-time updates
4. Add classroom analytics (test completion rates, average scores)
5. Add bulk student import via CSV
