## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### Podium Not Showing
**Check:**
- Are there at least 3 participants?
- Is the current user in top 3?
- Did the score meet threshold (60%+)?
- Is `showPodium` state true?
- Check browser console for errors

**Debug:**
```javascript
// In browser console:
localStorage.getItem('user') // Check user data
```

### Trophy Not Appearing
**Check:**
- Is placement 1, 2, or 3?
- Is score ≥80%?
- Did trophy animation complete?
- Check `showTrophyReveal` state

### Sounds Not Playing
**Check:**
- Is sound toggle enabled? (top-right)
- Did user interact with page first? (autoplay policy)
- Check browser console for errors
- Try clicking sound toggle off/on
- Check browser's sound permissions

### Haptics Not Working
**Check:**
- Is device mobile? (desktop doesn't have vibration)
- Is Vibration API supported? (check console)
- Is haptic toggle enabled?
- iOS: Did user grant motion permission?
- Some browsers block vibration

### Animations Laggy
**Solutions:**
- Reduce particle count on low-end devices
- Disable some animations
- Close other tabs
- Check CPU usage
- Try on a faster device

### Confetti Not Appearing
**Check:**
- Is `canvas-confetti` installed?
